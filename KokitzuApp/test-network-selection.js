/**
 * Test Script: Network Selection Debug
 *
 * This script helps debug the network selection issue in the WalletConnect modal.
 *
 * Issue: Clicking on the selected network doesn't allow changing to another network.
 *
 * Debug Steps:
 * 1. Open the app and navigate to any screen
 * 2. Click "Connect Wallet" button
 * 3. Check console logs for modal state debugging
 * 4. Click on the network selector
 * 5. Check if network modal opens (console log should show "📱 Network modal opened")
 * 6. Try clicking on different network options
 * 7. Check console logs for network selection clicks
 *
 * Expected Console Logs:
 * - "🔍 Modal states: { showModal: true, showNetworkModal: false, isNetworkSwitching: false }"
 * - "🔘 Network selector clicked, opening modal"
 * - "📱 Network modal opened"
 * - "🔘 Network item clicked: [network_name]"
 * - "🌐 Network selection clicked: [network_name]"

console.log("🔍 Check Console Logs:");
console.log(
  "  • Modal states should show showModal: true when wallet modal is open"
);
console.log(
  "  • Network selector click should log '🔘 Network selector clicked, opening modal'"
);
console.log(
  "  • Network modal should log '📱 Network modal opened' when it appears"
);
console.log(
  "  • Network item clicks should log '🔘 Network item clicked: [network]'"
);
console.log(
  "  • Network selection should log '🌐 Network selection clicked: [network]'"

console.log("🚨 Potential Issues:");
console.log("  1. Modal overlay blocking touch events");
console.log("  2. Nested modal causing touch conflicts");
console.log("  3. Network switching state preventing interaction");
console.log("  4. TouchableOpacity not receiving press events");
console.log("");

console.log("🔧 Debugging Steps:");
console.log("  1. Open app and click 'Connect Wallet'");
console.log("  2. Check console for modal state logs");
console.log("  3. Click network selector and check for click logs");
console.log("  4. If modal opens, try clicking network options");
console.log("  5. Check for network selection logs");
console.log("");

console.log("💡 If Network Modal Doesn't Open:");
console.log("  • Check if showNetworkModal state is being set");
console.log("  • Verify modal overlay isn't blocking touches");
console.log("  • Check if isNetworkSwitching is preventing interaction");
console.log("");

console.log("💡 If Network Modal Opens But Selection Doesn't Work:");
console.log("  • Check if handleNetworkSelect is being called");
console.log("  • Verify switchNetwork function is working");
console.log("  • Check for any errors in network switching");
console.log("");

console.log("🎯 Test the following:");
console.log("  1. Click 'Connect Wallet' → Should see modal state logs");
console.log(
  "  2. Click network selector → Should see click log and modal open"
);
console.log("  3. Click different network → Should see selection logs");
console.log("  4. Network should change and modal should close");
