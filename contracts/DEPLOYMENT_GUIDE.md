# BinaryOptions Smart Contract Deployment Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT UPDATE** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**The contract has been fixed with proper Sepolia price feeds!**

**Previous Issue**: The original contract was using Mainnet Chainlink price feeds while deploying to Sepolia, causing asset configuration failures.

**‚úÖ Fixed**: Now uses correct Sepolia testnet price feeds and will configure BTC, ETH, LINK, and MATIC automatically on deployment.

---

This guide will help you deploy the BinaryOptions smart contract to Ethereum networks and integrate it with your applications.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the `contracts` directory:

```env
# Private key of the account that will deploy the contract
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# RPC URLs
MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY


# Etherscan API key for contract verification
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key_here
```

### 3. Compile Contracts

```bash
npm run compile or npx hardhat compile
```

### 4. Deploy to Sepolia Testnet (Recommended)

```bash
# Deploy to Sepolia testnet with pre-configured assets
npm run deploy:sepolia
```

**What happens during deployment:**

- ‚úÖ Contract deploys with your address as owner
- ‚úÖ **BTC** asset configured (0.0001-1 ETH, 2% fee)
- ‚úÖ **ETH** asset configured (0.001-2 ETH, 1.5% fee)
- ‚úÖ **LINK** asset configured (0.005-1.5 ETH, 2% fee)
- ‚úÖ **MATIC** asset configured (0.01-2 ETH, 2.5% fee)
- ‚úÖ All assets active and ready for betting immediately!

### 5. Update Server Configuration

After successful deployment, update your server's `.env` file:

```bash
# Replace with your new contract address
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourNewContractAddress
```

### 6. Test the Deployment

```bash
# In your server directory
npm run configure-assets
# Should show: "‚úÖ BTC already configured: { isActive: true }"
```

### 7. Deploy to Mainnet (Production)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Before mainnet deployment**, update the price feeds in `BinaryOptions.sol` constructor to use **mainnet addresses**:

```solidity
// Replace Sepolia feeds with Mainnet feeds:
_setupAsset("ETH", 0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419, 0.001 ether, 2 ether, 150);
_setupAsset("BTC", 0xF4030086522a5bEEa4988F8cA5B36dbC97BeE88c, 0.0001 ether, 1 ether, 200);
```

Then deploy:

```bash
npm run deploy:mainnet
```

## üìã Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Get Test ETH

For testnet deployment, you'll need test ETH:

- **Sepolia**: Get from [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)
- **Goerli**: Get from [Goerli Faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/)

### Step 2: Configure Network

The contract is pre-configured with Chainlink price feeds for:

- ETH/USD: `0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419`
- BTC/USD: `0xF4030086522a5bEEa4988F8cA5B36dbC97BeE88c`
- MATIC/USD: `0x7bAC85A8a13A4BcD8abb3eB7d6b4ddecC6C5ca2a`

### Step 3: Deploy Contract

```bash
# For local development
npm run deploy:local

# For testnet
npm run deploy:sepolia

# For mainnet (BE CAREFUL!)
npm run deploy:mainnet
```

### Step 4: Verify Contract

After deployment, verify the contract on Etherscan:

```bash
# For Sepolia
npm run verify:sepolia

# For Goerli
npm run verify:goerli

# For Mainnet
npm run verify:mainnet
```

## üîß Contract Configuration

### Asset Configuration

The contract supports multiple assets. You can add new assets after deployment:

```javascript
// Example: Add SOL/USD
await contract.updateAssetConfig(
  "SOL",
  "0xEe9F2375b4bdF6387aa8265dD4FB8F16512A1d46", // SOL/USD price feed
  ethers.utils.parseEther("0.01"), // min amount
  ethers.utils.parseEther("10"), // max amount
  150 // fee percentage (1.5%)
);
```

### Platform Fee

The platform fee is set to 2% by default. You can update it:

```javascript
await contract.updatePlatformFee(150); // 1.5%
```

## üì± React Native Integration

### 1. Update Contract Address

After deployment, update the contract address in your React Native app:

```typescript
// src/services/binaryOptionsContract.ts
const CONTRACT_ADDRESSES = {
  mainnet: "0x...", // Your deployed mainnet address
  sepolia: "0x...", // Your deployed sepolia address
  goerli: "0x...", // Your deployed goerli address
  localhost: "0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3",
};
```

### 2. Add Trading Component

Import and use the BinaryOptionsTrading component:

```typescript
import BinaryOptionsTrading from "../components/BinaryOptionsTrading";

// In your screen
<BinaryOptionsTrading asset="BTC" currentPrice="45000" />;
```

### 3. Test Integration

1. Connect your wallet
2. Click "Trade Binary Options"
3. Select amount, expiry time, and option type
4. Create the option
5. Wait for expiry and execute

## üîí Security Considerations

### 1. Access Control

- Only the contract owner can update asset configurations
- Only the contract owner can withdraw platform fees
- Users can only execute their own options

### 2. Reentrancy Protection

The contract uses OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks.

### 3. Price Feed Validation

- All price feeds are validated before use
- Invalid prices will revert the transaction

### 4. Amount Limits

- Minimum and maximum amounts are enforced per asset
- Prevents dust attacks and excessive risk

## üí∞ Economic Model

### Payout Structure

- **Win**: 80% of bet amount (20% house edge)
- **Loss**: 0% (lose entire bet)

### Example

- Bet: 0.1 ETH
- Win payout: 0.08 ETH
- House edge: 0.02 ETH

## üß™ Testing

### Local Testing

```bash
# Start local node
npm run node

# Deploy to local network
npm run deploy:local

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Test Scenarios

1. **Create Option**: Test option creation with different parameters
2. **Execute Option**: Test option execution after expiry
3. **Price Movement**: Test both call and put scenarios
4. **Edge Cases**: Test minimum/maximum amounts, expiry times

## üìä Monitoring

### Events to Monitor

- `OptionCreated`: When a new option is created
- `OptionExecuted`: When an option is executed
- `AssetConfigUpdated`: When asset configuration changes

### Key Metrics

- Total options created
- Total volume traded
- Contract balance
- Win/loss ratio

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Pause Asset

If an asset needs to be paused:

```javascript
await contract.pauseAsset("BTC");
```

### Resume Asset

To resume trading:

```javascript
await contract.resumeAsset("BTC");
```

### Withdraw Fees

To withdraw accumulated platform fees:

```javascript
await contract.withdrawFees();
```

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the deployment logs
2. Verify contract on Etherscan
3. Test with small amounts first
4. Ensure sufficient gas for transactions

## üîÑ Updates

To update the contract:

1. Deploy new version
2. Update address in React Native app
3. Migrate user data if necessary
4. Update documentation

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Always test thoroughly on testnets before deploying to mainnet. Never deploy with real funds without proper testing.

### 1. What is the ABI and Why You Need It

- The ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a JSON file describing your contract‚Äôs interface.
- It‚Äôs required for both reading from and writing to the contract using libraries like ethers.js or web3.js.

### 2. How to Get the ABI (for both Ethereum and Sepolia)

- **Compile the contract:**  
  Run `npx hardhat compile` in your `/contracts` directory.
- **Locate the ABI:**  
  After compiling, find the ABI in `artifacts/contracts/BinaryOptions.sol/BinaryOptions.json` (the `abi` key).
- **Deploy the contract:**  
  Deploy to Sepolia or Mainnet:
  ```sh
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mainnet
  ```
  The script will print the contract address‚Äîsave this for your config.
- **Note:**  
  The ABI is the same for both networks if the contract code is unchanged. Only the address differs.

### 3. What does it mean for the server to sign transactions?

- When your server writes to the contract (e.g., placing a bet), it must sign the transaction with a private key.
- The private key should belong to a dedicated server wallet (never a user‚Äôs wallet).
